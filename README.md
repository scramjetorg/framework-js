Scramjet is a simple reactive stream programming framework. The code is written by chaining functions that transform the streamed data, including well known map, filter and reduce.

The main advantage of Scramjet is running asynchronous operations on your data streams concurrently. It allows you to perform the transformations both synchronously and asynchronously by using the same API - so now you can "map" your stream from whatever source and call any number of API's consecutively.

This is a pre-release of the next major version (v5) of [JavaScript Scramjet Framework](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet).

**We are open to your feedback!** You can report an issue with any ideas, suggestions and features you would like to see in this version. You can also upvote (`+1`) existing issues to show us the direction we should take in developing Scramjet Framework.

## Installation

Since this is a pre-release version it is not available as a npm package yet. However, it can be used as npm dependencies by referring to `nightly` branch from this repository:

_package.json_
```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "scramjet": "scramjetorg/scramjet-dev#nightly"
    }
}
```

and then used like:

_sample-file.ts_
```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";
```

You can also build it yourself. Please refer to [Development Setup](#development-setup) section for more details.

## Usage

Scramjet streams are similar and behave similar to native nodejs streams and to streams in any programing language in general. The allow operating on streams of data (were each separate data part is called a `chunk`) and process it in any way through transforms like mapping or filtering.

Let's take a look how to create and operate on Scramjet streams.

If you would like to dive deeper please refer to [stream source file](tree/main/src/streams).

### Creating Scramjet streams

The basic method for creating Scramjet streams is `from()` static method. It accepts iterbales (both sync and async) and native nodejs streams. As for iterables it can be a simple array, generator or anything iterable:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const stream = DataStream.from(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);
```

Scramjet streams are asynchronous iterables itself, which means one stream can be created from another:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const stream1 = DataStream.from(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);
const stream2 = DataStream.from(stream1);
```

They can be also created from native nodejs Readables:

```ts
import { createReadStream } from "fs";
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const stream = DataStream.from(createReadStream("path/to/file"));
```

The more "manual" approach is creating streams using constructor:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const stream = new DataStream();
```

Such approach is useful when one needs to manually write data to a stream or use it as pipe destination:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const stream = new DataStream();
stream.write("foo");

const stream2 = new DataStream();
stream.pipe(stream2);
```

### Getting data from Scramjet streams

Similar as to creating Scramjet streams, there are specific methods which allows getting data out of them. Those are sometimes called `sink` methods as they allow data to flow through and out of the stream. As those methods needs to wait for the stream end, they return a `Promise` which need to be awaited and is resolved when all data from source is processed.

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const stream1 = DataStream.from(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);
await stream1.toArray(); // ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

const stream2 = DataStream.from(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);
await stream2.toFile("path/to/file"); // Writes to a file, resolves when done.

const stream3 = DataStream.from(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);
await stream3.reduce(
    (prev, curr) => `${ prev }-${ curr }`,
    ""
); // "foo-bar-baz"
```

As Scramjet streams are asynchronous iterables they can be itarated too:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const stream = DataStream.from(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);

for await (const chunk of stream) {
    console.log(chunk);
}
// Logs:
// "foo"
// "bar"
// "baz"
```

Similar to writing, there is also more "manual" way to read from streams using `.read()` method:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const stream = DataStream.from(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);

await stream.read(); // "foo"
await stream.read(); // "bar"
```

Read returns a Promise which waits until there is something ready to be read from a stream.

### Basic operations

The whole idea of stream processing is an ability to quickly and efficiently transfom data which flows through the stream. Let's take a look at basic operations (called `transforms`) and what they do.

#### Mapping

Mapping stream data is bascially the same as mapping array. It allows to map a chunk to a new value:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

DataStream
    .from(["foo", "bar", "baz"])
    .map(chunk => chunk.repeat(2))
    .toArray(); // ["foofoo", "barbar", "bazbaz"]
```

The result of the map transform could be of different type than initial chunks:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

DataStream
    .from(["foo", "bar", "baz"])
    .map(chunk => chunk.charCodeAt(0))
    .toArray(); // [102, 98, 98]

DataStream
    .from(["foo", "bar", "baz"])
    .map(chunk => chunk.split(""))
    .toArray(); // [["f", "o", "o"], ["b", "a", "r"], ["b", "a", "z"]]
```

#### Filtering

Filtering allows to filter out any unnecessary chunks:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

DataStream
    .from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    .filter(chunk => chunk % 2 === 0)
    .toArray(); // [2, 4, 6]
```

#### Grouping

Batching allows to group chunks into arrays, effecitvely changing chunks number flowing though the stream:

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

DataStream
    .from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
    .batch(chunk => chunk % 2 === 0)
    .toArray(); // [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]
```

Whenever callback function passed to `.batch()` call returns true, new group is emitted.
#### Pipeing

Pipeing is essential for operating on streams. Scramjet streams can be both used as pipe source and destination. They can be also combined with native nodejs streams having native streams as pipe source or destination.

```ts
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const stream1 = DataStream.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]);
const stream2 = new DataStream();

stream1.pipe(stream2); // All data flowing through "stream1" will be passed to "stream2".
```

```ts
import { createReadStream } from "fs";
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const readStream = createReadStream("path/to/file"));
const scramjetStream = new DataStream();

readStream.pipe(scramjetStream); // All file contents read by native nodejs stream will be passed to "stream2".
```

```ts
import { createWriteStream } from "fs";
import { DataStream } from "scramjet";

const scramjetStream = DataStream.from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]);

scramjetStream.pipe(createWriteStream("path/to/file")); // All data flowing through "scramjetStream" will be written to a file via native nodejs stream.
```

Please refer to [Development Setup](#development-setup) section on how to setup this project.

## Development Setup

### Node.js (14.x)

Refer to [official docs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Alternatively you may use Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Project setup

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:scramjetorg/scramjet-dev.git
```

2. Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

### Commands

There are multiple npm commands avaialble which helps to run test,build the project and help during development.

#### Running tests

```bash
npm run test
```

Runs all tests from `test` directory. It runs `build` internally so it doesn't have to be run manually.

```bash
npm run test:unit[:w]
```

Runs all unit tests (`test/unit` directory). It runs `build` internally so it doesn't have to be run manually. When run with `:w` it will watch for changes, rebuild and rerun test automatically. To run unit tests wihtout rebuilding the project use `npm run test:run:unit`.

```bash
npm run test:unit:d -- build/test/.../test.js [--host ...] [--port ...]
```

Runs specified test file in a debug mode. It runs `build` internally so it doesn't have to be run manually. This is the same as running
`npm run build && npx ava debug --break build/test/.../test.js [--host ...] [--port ...]`. Then it can be inpsected e.g. via Chrome inspector
by going to `chrome://inspect`.

```bash
npm run test:bdd
```

Runs all BDD tests (`test/bdd` directory). It runs `build` internally so it doesn't have to be run manually. To run BDD tests wihtout rebuilding the project use `npm run test:run:bdd`.

**Running single test file or specific tests**

Single test file can be run by passing its path to `test` command:

```bash
npm run test:unit -- build/test/ifca/common.spec.js
```

While specific test cases can be run using `-m` (match) option:

```bash
npm run test:unit -- -m "*default*"
```

Both can be mixed to run specific tests from a given file or folder:

```bash
npm run test:unit -- build/test/ifca/common.spec.js -m "*default*"
```

#### Building the project

```bash
npm run build[:w]
```

Transpiles `.ts` sources and tests (`src` and `test` directories) and outputs JS files to `build` directory. When run with `:w` it will watch for changes and rebuild automatically.

```bash
npm run dist
```

Builds dist files - similar to `build` but skips `test` directory and additionaly generates source maps.

#### Miscellaneous

```bash
npm run lint
```

Lints `src` and `test` directories. Used as a `pre-commit` hook.

```bash
npm run lint:f
```

Fixes lint warnings/errors in `src` and `test` files.

```bash
npm run coverage
```

Checks code coverage, generates HTML report and serves it on 8080 port.

```bash
npm run coverage:check
```

Checks code coverage. Will fail if it is below a threshold defined in `package.json`. Useful as a CI job.

```bash
npm run coverage:generate
```
