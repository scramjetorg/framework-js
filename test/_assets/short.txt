Scramjet is a fast, simple, free and open source functional reactive
 stream programming framework written on top of node.js streams with
 multi-threadding support. The code is written by chaining functions
 that transform data easily with ES7 async/await syntax. It is built
 upon the logic behind three well known javascript array operations:
 map, filter and reduce. Scramjet transforms are so standard and natural
 that we're sure you can start writing your code straight away.
